# AI-Powered People Detection and Recording System

This Next.js 14 website is designed to use artificial intelligence to detect people, record a 30-second clip when it detects people, and save it for review later. The project is written entirely in TypeScript and utilizes the TensorFlow COCO-SSD model for object detection, which aims to localize and identify multiple objects in a single image. The UI is built using the ShadcnUI library.
